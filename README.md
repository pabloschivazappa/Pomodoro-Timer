The pomodoro technique has six steps:

1- Decide on the task to be done.
2- Set the pomodoro timer (typically for 25 minutes).
3- Work on the task.
4- End work when the timer rings and take a short break (typically 5â€“10 minutes).
5- If you have finished fewer than three pomodoros, go back to Step 2 and repeat until you go through all three pomodoros.
6- After three pomodoros are done, take the fourth pomodoro and then take a long break (typically 20 to 30 minutes). Once the long break is finished, return to step 2.
